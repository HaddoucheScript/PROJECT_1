"# PROJECT_1" 
AI4I Predictive Maintenance — End-to-End Machine Learning Project
Overview
This project develops a full predictive maintenance pipeline using the AI4I dataset. The goal is to anticipate machine failures based on operational sensor data and provide actionable insights for industrial decision-makers.

The repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, supervised classification modeling, explainability, clustering, and deployment through a lightweight dashboard.
